3DES - Triple Data Encryption Standard

DES is a block cipher, with 64 bit blocks.
DES was deemed unsafe besause of its small key size (56 bits) and was broken in 1998.

(In the 8 byte key 1 byte is for parity checking)

Triple DES is just DES used 3 times with different keys.


Encryption:
	1) Encrypt data with key1
	2) Then decrypt with key2
	3) Then encrypt data with key3

Decryption:
	1) Decrypt with key3
	2) Then encrypt with key2
	3) Then decrypt with key1
