Hash - Message Digest Algorithm

One way function; used for password storage, digital signatures and so on.

Salt:
	Random data added to a plaintext to make a unique hash.
	For example:
		There are two passwords in a db that are the same - ("Gela", "Gela").
		Their hashes will be different because of the salts used.
		This protects both passwords from being exposed if one is cracked.

		Salts should be kept along with the password hash.


Iterations:
	Basically a hashing algorithm is run many times (n iterations).
	This makes the computation take longer and, in turn, the password cracking takes longer as well
