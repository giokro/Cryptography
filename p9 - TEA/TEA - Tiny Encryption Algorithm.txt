Tiny Encryption Algorithm is one of the fastest and most efficient cryptographic algorithms ever.

It uses XOR, Addition and bitwise shifts to encrypt data.

It encrypts 64 bits of data at a time with a 128 bit key.

It has a short routine and uses a large number of rounds for security.

In our example we used 32 rounds.
