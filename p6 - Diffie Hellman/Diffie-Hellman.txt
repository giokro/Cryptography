Diffie-Hellman Algorithm

This is used to exchange keys between two parties.
In this case Alice and Bob.

Private:
	Alice: a
	Bob: b

Public:
	p: A prime number (This is the modulus)
	g: A number which is a coprime of p-1  (This is the base)

	Alice sends Bob:
		A = (g^a) mod p

	Bob sends Alice:
		B = (g^b) mod p


Now Alice has B and Bob has A when they add their own private values they will get the shared key:

	B^a == A^b
	
	or

	(g^a)^b mod p == (g^b)^a mod p
